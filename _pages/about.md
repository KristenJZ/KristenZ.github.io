# About Me 
My name is Jing (Kristen) Zhang. I am a Ph.D. student in [the Department of Communication and Media at the University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/comm). I completed my Bachelor's degree from [the School of Journalism at Fudan University](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/n1339/index.html) and my Master's degree from [the Department of Communication Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://communication.charlotte.edu/). 

My research primarily centers around **communication technology, science communication, and media effects** from the perspective of media psychology. Specifically, I use survey and experimental studies to investigate:

a) **How emerging technologies and narratives bring new opportunities and challenges to controversial science topics.**

b) **How people perceive the connection between extreme weather and anthropogenic climate change from news and social media.**

c) **How technical affordances influence human behaviors such as media consumption and engagement in various contexts such as science, entertainment, and politics.** 

My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as the *Journal of Communication*, *Telematics and Informatics*.
